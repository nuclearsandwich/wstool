The core functionality of abstracting over different version control systems is contained in the library project https://github.com/vcstools/vcstools.

Developer Environment
---------------------

For many tasks, it is okay to just develop using a single installed python version. But if you need to test/debug the project in multiple python versions, you need to install those versions::

1. (Optional) Install multiple python versions

   1. (Optional) Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer) to manage python versions
   2. (Optional) Using pyenv, install the python versions used in testing::

       pyenv install 2.7.16
       pyenv install 3.6.8

It may be okay to run and test python against locally installed libraries, but if you need to have a consistent build, it is recommended to manage your environment using `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_::

  $ virtualenv ~/wstool_venv
  $ source ~/wstool_venv/bin/activate

Testing
-------

Prerequisites:

* The tests require git, mercurial, bazaar and subversion to be installed.

Also you need to install python test support libraries::

  # install python dependencies
  $ pip install .[test]
  # optional also use local vcstools sources directly
  $ pip install --editable /path/to/vcstools_source

Then you can use different commands to run various test scopes::

  # run all tests using nose
  $ nosetests
  # run one test using nose
  $ nosetests {testname}
  # run all tests with coverage check
  $ python setup.py test
  # run all tests using python3
  $ python3 setup.py test
  # run all tests against multiple python versions (same as in travis)
  $ tox
